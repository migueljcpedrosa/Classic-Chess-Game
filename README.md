In this exciting game you can play chess with your friends, using a clean but effective piece design.

This project was developed by Miguel Pedrosa (up202108809@fe.up.pt), Luís Sousa (up202005832@fc.up.pt) and Xavier Santos (up202108894@fe.up.pt) for LDTS 2021⁄2022.

## How to play:
To play the game, use the arrow keys or WASD to move the selector up, down, left, or right.

To select a piece, press the spacebar (' ').

Once a piece is selected, you can see all possible moves by pressing the spacebar again. If you decide not to move the piece, press the Escape key (Esc) to deselect it.

To make a move, select the piece you want to move and then select the desired location on the board.

If the game is over, press R to start a new game. You can end the game at any time by pressing X.

Remember that the game also suggests all possible moves for the selected piece, so be sure to consider all your options before making a move.
